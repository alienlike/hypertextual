Welcome!

Hypertextual is a simple hypertext platform. It uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
for formatting, and wiki-like links for getting around. All pages are versioned, and every user has both a
public and a private home page. This allows Hypertextual to serve as a free-form web presence, as well as a
private repository for notes, lists, and documents.
